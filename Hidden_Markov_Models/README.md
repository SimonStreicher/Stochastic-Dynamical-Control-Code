## Instructions for running the code in this folder

Point Julia's working directory to this folder using `cd("~\Hidden_Markov_Models")`. Then:

1. Execute `include("HMM_tests.jl")` to run the tests.
2. Execute `include("HMM_burglar_example.jl")` to run the burglar example as found in [David Barber's Bayesian Reasoning and Machine Learning: ](http://web4.cs.ucl.ac.uk/staff/D.Barber/pmwiki/pmwiki.php?n=Brml.HomePage). Edit this script if you would like to change parameters.
