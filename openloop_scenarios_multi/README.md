# Open Loop Systems

This folder contains all the scripts used to generate the open loop figures as shown in my masters.

**It is necessary to run the script `init_sys.jl` in the root directory to load all the external and internal libraries.**

The abbreviations used to name the scripts are explained here:

1) `PF` => Particle Filter

2) `RBPF` => Rao-Blackwellised PF

3) `SPF` => Switching PF

4) `_E3` => the observer uses 3 models to perform inference

5) `_M1` => the observer measures 1 state
