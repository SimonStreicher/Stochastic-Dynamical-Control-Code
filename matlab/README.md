# Matlab Scripts
This folder contains all the Matlab scripts. They are primarily used for sanity checking and computer aided algebraic derivations.

1. Execute `Linearised_Runge_Kutta.m` to derive the expressions converting the nonlinear model into a linear discrete Runge-Kutta model.
2. Execute `Reactor_Matlab.m` to run the integration routine on the nonlinear model.
