# Open Loop Scenarios

This folder contains stand alone scripts for illustration purposes. They are derived from the scripts in the folder `closedloop`.

**It is necessary to run the script `init_sys.jl` in the root directory to load all the external and internal libraries.**

The abbreviations used to name the scripts are explained here:

1) HMM = hidden markov model
2) KL = Kullback-Leibler
3) PF = Particle Filter
4) KF = Kalman Filter
5) M1 = the observer uses 1 state measurement
